# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this errata baseline.

## How to propose a correction

1. Open an issue or pull request.
2. Include evidence:
   - Appendix PDF snippet (or exact quoted text), and
   - The proposed corrected form.
3. Explain whether the change is for:
   - strict syntax validity,
   - internal consistency, or
   - clarified interpretation of ambiguous appendix text.

## Acceptance criteria

- Change keeps ADF 1.0 element/attribute names intact.
- Examples continue to validate against both `schema/adf-1.0-errata.dtd` and `schema/adf-1.0-errata.xsd`.
- `ERRATA.md` is updated with location, source snippet, correction, and rationale.
